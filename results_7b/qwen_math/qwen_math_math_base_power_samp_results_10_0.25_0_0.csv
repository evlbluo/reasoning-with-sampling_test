"Convert the point $(0,3)$ in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.  Enter your answer in the form $(r,\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \le \theta < 2 \pi.$","\left( 3, \frac{\pi}{2} \right)"," To convert the point \((0, 3)\) from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, we need to find the values of \(r\) and \(\theta\). The formulas for converting from rectangular coordinates \((x, y)\) to polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\) are:

\[
r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

\[
\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)
\]

Given the point \((0, 3)\), we have \(x = 0\) and \(y = 3\).

### Step 1: Calculate \(r\)
\[
r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \(\theta\)
\[
\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{3}{0}\right)
\]

The expression \(\frac{3}{0}\) is undefined because division by zero is not allowed. However, we know that when \(x = 0\) and \(y > 0\), the point lies on the positive \(y\)-axis. In this case, the angle \(\theta\) is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) radians (or 90 degrees).

### Step 3: Verify the range of \(\theta\)
The angle \(\theta\) must be in the range \(0 \le \theta < 2\pi\). The angle \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) is within this range.

### Final Answer
Thus, the polar coordinates of the point \((0, 3)\) are:

\[
\boxed{(3, \frac{\pi}{2})}
\]","(3, \frac{\pi}{2})"," To convert the point $(0, 3)$ from rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates to polar coordinates, we need to find the radius $r$ and the angle $\theta$. The formulas to convert from rectangular coordinates $(x, y)$ to polar coordinates $(r, \theta)$ are:

1. $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$
2. $\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)$, with the correct quadrant taken into account.

For the point $(0, 3)$:
- $x = 0$
- $y = 3$

Let's calculate $r$ first:
\[ r = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3 \]

Next, let's calculate $\theta$:
\[ \theta = \arctan\left(\frac{3}{0}\right) \]

However, the arctangent function in most programming languages (including Python) will not be able to handle division by zero directly. Instead, we need to consider the geometric interpretation. When $x = 0$ and $y = 3$, the point lies on the positive y-axis. In polar coordinates, this corresponds to an angle of $\frac{\pi}{2}$.

So, the polar coordinates for the point $(0, 3)$ are $(3, \frac{\pi}{2})$.

Let's confirm this with Python code to ensure accuracy.
```python
import math

# Rectangular coordinates
x = 0
y = 3

# Calculate the radius r
r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)

# Calculate the angle theta
# Since x is 0, we need to handle this case separately
if x == 0:
    if y > 0:
        theta = math.pi / 2
    elif y < 0:
        theta = 3 * math.pi / 2
    else:  # y == 0
        theta = 0
else:
    theta = math.atan2(y, x)

# Ensure theta is in the range [0, 2*pi)
theta = theta % (2 * math.pi)

print(((r, theta)))
```
```output
(3.0, 1.5707963267948966)
```
The polar coordinates for the point $(0, 3)$ are $(3.0, \frac{\pi}{2})$, which confirms our earlier reasoning.

So the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{(3, \frac{\pi}{2})}
\]","(3, \frac{\pi}{2})","Can you solve the following math problem? Convert the point $(0,3)$ in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.  Enter your answer in the form $(r,\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \le \theta < 2 \pi.$ Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{{}}. To convert the point $(0,3)$ from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, we need to find the values of $r$ and $\theta$.

1. **Finding $r$:**
   - The distance from the origin to the point $(0,3)$ is given by the formula $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.
   - Substituting $x = 0$ and $y = 3$, we get $r = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3$.

2. **Finding $\theta$:**
   - The angle $\theta$ is the angle between the positive x-axis and the line connecting the origin to the point $(0,3)$.
   - Since the point $(0,3)$ lies on the positive y-axis, $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$.

Therefore, the polar coordinates of the point $(0,3)$ are $\boxed{(3, \frac{\pi}{2})}$.","(3, \frac{\pi}{2})"
