"Convert the point $(0,3)$ in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.  Enter your answer in the form $(r,\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \le \theta < 2 \pi.$","\left( 3, \frac{\pi}{2} \right)"," To convert the point $(0, 3)$ from rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates to polar coordinates, we need to find the radius $r$ and the angle $\theta$.

1. **Calculate the radius $r$:**
   The radius $r$ is the distance from the origin to the point $(0, 3)$. It can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
   \]
   For the point $(0, 3)$, we have $x = 0$ and $y = 3$. So,
   \[
   r = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3
   \]

2. **Calculate the angle $\theta$:**
   The angle $\theta$ is the angle between the positive x-axis and the line segment connecting the origin to the point $(0, 3)$. It can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \theta = \arctan\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)
   \]
   However, since $x = 0$ and $y = 3$, the point $(0, 3)$ lies on the positive y-axis. The angle $\theta$ for this point is $\frac{\pi}{2}$ radians (or 90 degrees).

So, the polar coordinates of the point $(0, 3)$ are $(3, \frac{\pi}{2})$.

Let's confirm this with Python code.
```python
import math

# Rectangular coordinates
x = 0
y = 3

# Calculate the radius r
r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)

# Calculate the angle theta
# Since x is 0, we need to handle this case separately
if x == 0:
    if y > 0:
        theta = math.pi / 2
    elif y < 0:
        theta = 3 * math.pi / 2
    else:  # y == 0
        theta = 0
else:
    theta = math.atan2(y, x)

# Ensure theta is in the range [0, 2*pi)
if theta < 0:
    theta += 2 * math.pi

print(((r, theta)))
```
```output
(3.0, 1.5707963267948966)
```
The polar coordinates of the point $(0, 3)$ are \(\left(3, \frac{\pi}{2}\right)\).

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\left(3, \frac{\pi}{2}\right)}
\]","\left(3, \frac{\pi}{2}\right)"," To convert the point $(0,3)$ from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, we need to find the values of $r$ (the radius) and $\theta$ (the angle).

1. Calculate the radius ($r$) using the distance formula from the origin:
\[
r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]
In our case, $x = 0$ and $y = 3$:
\[
r = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3
\]

2. Calculate the angle ($\theta$) using the arctangent function:
\[
\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)
\]
However, since $x = 0$, $\arctan(\frac{y}{x})$ is not defined. In such cases, we need to determine the angle by considering the quadrant in which the point lies. The point $(0,3)$ lies on the positive y-axis, so:
\[
\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}
\]

Thus, the point $(0,3)$ in rectangular coordinates is equivalent to $(3, \frac{\pi}{2})$ in polar coordinates. Let's verify this using Python.
```python
import math

# Rectangular coordinates
x = 0
y = 3

# Calculate r
r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)

# Calculate theta (considering the quadrant)
# Since x = 0, theta is either pi/2 or 3*pi/2 depending on the sign of y
theta = math.pi / 2 if x == 0 and y > 0 else (3 * math.pi) / 2

print(((r, theta)))
```
```output
(3.0, 1.5707963267948966)
```
The calculations confirm that the point $(0,3)$ in rectangular coordinates is equivalent to $(3, \frac{\pi}{2})$ in polar coordinates. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{(3, \frac{\pi}{2})}
\]","(3, \frac{\pi}{2})","Can you solve the following math problem? Convert the point $(0,3)$ in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.  Enter your answer in the form $(r,\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \le \theta < 2 \pi.$ Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{{}}. To convert the point \((0, 3)\) from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, we need to find the values of \(r\) and \(\theta\). The formulas for converting from rectangular coordinates \((x, y)\) to polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\) are:

\[
r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

\[
\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)
\]

Given the point \((0, 3)\), we have \(x = 0\) and \(y = 3\).

### Step 1: Calculate \(r\)
Using the formula for \(r\):

\[
r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \(\theta\)
Using the formula for \(\theta\):

\[
\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{3}{0}\right)
\]

The expression \(\frac{3}{0}\) is undefined because division by zero is not allowed. However, we can determine \(\theta\) by considering the position of the point \((0, 3)\) in the coordinate plane. The point \((0, 3)\) lies on the positive \(y\)-axis.

In polar coordinates, the angle \(\theta\) for a point on the positive \(y\)-axis is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) radians.

### Final Answer
Thus, the polar coordinates of the point \((0, 3)\) are:

\[
\boxed{(3, \frac{\pi}{2})}
