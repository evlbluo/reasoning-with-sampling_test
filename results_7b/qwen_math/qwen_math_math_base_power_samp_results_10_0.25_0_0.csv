"Convert the point $(0,3)$ in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.  Enter your answer in the form $(r,\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \le \theta < 2 \pi.$","\left( 3, \frac{\pi}{2} \right)"," To convert the point \((0, 3)\) from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, we need to find the values of \(r\) and \(\theta\). The formulas for converting from rectangular coordinates \((x, y)\) to polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\) are:

\[
r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]
\[
\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)
\]

Given the point \((0, 3)\), we have \(x = 0\) and \(y = 3\).

### Step 1: Calculate \(r\)
\[
r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \(\theta\)
\[
\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{3}{0}\right)
\]

The expression \(\frac{3}{0}\) is undefined, which indicates that the angle \(\theta\) is at a vertical line. Since the point \((0, 3)\) is located on the positive \(y\)-axis, the angle \(\theta\) is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) radians.

### Step 3: Verify the quadrant
The point \((0, 3)\) is in the first quadrant, and \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}\) is indeed within the range \(0 \le \theta < 2\pi\).

### Final Answer
Thus, the polar coordinates of the point \((0, 3)\) are:

\[
\boxed{(3, \frac{\pi}{2})}

Sure! I'd be happy to help you convert the point \((0, 3)\) from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. Let's go through the steps:

1. **Understand the relationship between rectangular and polar coordinates:**
   - In rectangular coordinates, a point is represented as \((x, y)\).
   - In polar coordinates, a point is represented as \((r, \theta)\), where:
     \[
     r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
     \]
     \[
     \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)
     \]

2. **Identify the given point in rectangular coordinates:**
   - The point given is \((0, 3)\), so \(x = 0\) and \(y = 3\).

3. **Calculate the radius \(r\):**
   \[
   r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3
   \]

4. **Determine the angle \(\theta\):**
   - The formula \(\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)\) would typically be used, but in this case, \(x = 0\), which makes the fraction \(\frac{y}{x}\) undefined.
   - When \(x = 0\) and \(y > 0\), the point lies on the positive \(y\)-axis. In polar coordinates, this corresponds to an angle of \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) radians.

5. **Combine \(r\) and \(\theta\) to form the polar coordinates:**
   - We have \(r = 3\) and \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}\).

Therefore, the polar coordinates of the point \((0, 3)\) are \(\boxed{(3, \frac{\pi}{2})}\).","(3, \frac{\pi}{2})","Can you solve the following math problem? Convert the point $(0,3)$ in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.

The expression \(\frac{3}{0}\) is undefined because division by zero is not allowed. However, we can determine \(\theta\) by considering the position of the point \((0, 3)\) in the coordinate plane. The point \((0, 3)\) lies on the positive \(y\)-axis.

In polar coordinates, the angle \(\theta\) for a point on the positive \(y\)-axis is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) radians.
